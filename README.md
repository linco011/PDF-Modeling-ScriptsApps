# PDF-Modeling-ScriptsApps
This is a fun little side project that I have been developing to model randomly generated numbers from distributions. 

The two files that I would like the user to pay attention too is the latest MarketData_scratchpad.ps1 file and the 
Generating_Random_Variables_From_a_Lorentzian_Distirbution.pdf
The pdf explains how to generate random variables from a lorentzian distribution which the MarketData_scratchpad.ps1 code emulates
the paper. 

There is another paper called Generating_Probability_Distribution_function_Draft that is only a draft that has incomplete information still on it.
